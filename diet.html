      diet &
      nutrition is to support overall health and wellbeing by providing the body with the necessary nutrients it needs
      to function properly."</p><br>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Diet and nutrition are essential
      components of a healthy lifestyle. They play a crucial role in maintaining overall physical and mental well-being.
      A balanced and nutritious diet helps the body to function optimally, prevents chronic diseases, and enhances the
      quality of life. The website, will tells the importance of diet and nutrition
      and some tips for maintaining a healthy and balanced diet.
    </p><br>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">The human body requires a variety
      of nutrients to function correctly, such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals. These nutrients
      provide energy, support growth and development, and help to maintain a healthy immune system. A lack of any of
      these nutrients can lead to various health problems such as malnutrition, weight gain, obesity, and
      chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and cance r.</p><br>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">A balanced and nutritious diet should consist
      of a variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, healthy fats, and low-fat dairy products. It
      is also essential to limit the intake of processed and sugary foods, saturated and trans fats, and sodium. The
      Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes the consumption of whole foods and healthy fats like olive oil, has been
      shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.
    </p><br>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">In addition to a healthy diet, it is essential
      to maintain a healthy weight and engage in regular physical activity. Exercise can help to improve heart health,
      strengthen muscles, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Experts recommend at least 150 minutes of
      moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week.
    </p>

    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">It is also important to stay hydrated by
      drinking plenty of water and avoiding sugary drinks like soda and juice. Adequate hydration helps to regulate body
      temperature, transport nutrients, and eliminate waste products from the body</p>

    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">In conclusion, diet and nutrition are
      essential components of a healthy lifestyle. A balanced and nutritious diet, regular exercise, and proper
      hydration are crucial for maintaining overall physical and mental well-being. By following these tips, you can
      improve your health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Remember, small changes in your diet and lifestyle
      can make a significant impact on your health in the long run.</p>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-3" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">For adults :</h1>
    <h1 class="ml-5 mb-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 24px;">A healthy diet includes the
      following:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Fruit, vegetables, legumes (e.g.
        lentils and beans), nuts and whole grains (e.g. unprocessed maize, millet, oats, wheat and brown rice).</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">At least 400 g (i.e. five portions) of
        fruit and vegetables per day (2), excluding potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava and other starchy roots.</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Less than 10% of total energy intake
        from free sugars (2, 7), which is equivalent to 50 g (or about 12 level teaspoons) for a person of healthy body
        weight consuming about 2000 calories per day, but ideally is less than 5% of total energy intake for additional
        health benefits (7). Free sugars are all sugars added to foods or drinks by the manufacturer, cook or consumer,
        as well as sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates.</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Less than 30% of total energy intake
        from fats (1, 2, 3). Unsaturated fats (found in fish, avocado and nuts, and in sunflower, soybean, canola and
        olive oils) are preferable to saturated fats (found in fatty meat, butter, palm and coconut oil, cream, cheese,
        ghee and lard) and trans-fats of all kinds, including both industrially-produced trans-fats (found in baked and
        fried foods, and pre-packaged snacks and foods, such as frozen pizza, pies, cookies, biscuits, wafers, and
        cooking oils and spreads) and ruminant trans-fats (found in meat and dairy foods from ruminant animals, such as
        cows, sheep, goats and camels). It is suggested that the intake of saturated fats be reduced to less than 10% of
        total energy intake and trans-fats to less than 1% of total energy intake (5). In particular,
        industrially-produced trans-fats are not part of a healthy diet and should be avoided (4, 6).</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Less than 5 g of salt (equivalent to
        about one teaspoon) per day (8). Salt should be iodized.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-3" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">For infants and young children
    </h1>

    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">In the first 2 years of a child’s life,
      optimal nutrition fosters healthy growth and improves cognitive development. It also reduces the risk of becoming
      overweight or obese and developing NCDs later in life.</p>

    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Advice on a healthy diet for infants and
      children is similar to that for adults, but the following elements are also important :</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Infants should be breastfed
        exclusively during the first 6 months of life.</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Infants should be breastfed
        continuously until 2 years of age and beyond.</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">From 6 months of age, breast milk
        should be complemented with a variety of adequate, safe and nutrient-dense foods. Salt and sugars should not be
        added to complementary foods.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">Diet and Nutrition for our
      Prognosis Test :
      <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">1) Blood Pressure Test:</h1>
    </h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;"> Making changes to your diet is a proven way
      to help control high blood pressure. These changes can also help you
      lose weight and lower your chance of heart disease and stroke.Your health care provider can refer you to a
      dietitian who can help you create a healthy meal plan. Ask what your blood pressure target is. Your target will be
      based on your risk factors and other medical problems.</p>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">1) DASH DIET</h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      The low-salt Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is proven to help lower blood pressure. Its
      effects on blood pressure are sometimes seen within a few weeks.This diet is rick important nutrients and fiber.
      It also includes foods that are higher in potassium, calcium, and
      magnesium lower in sodium (salt) than the typical American diet.
    </p>
    <p class="ml-5" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">
      The goals of the DASH diet are :
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Limit sodium to no more than 2,300 mg
        a day (eating only 1,500 mg a day is an even more effective goal).</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Reduce saturated fat to no more than
        6% of daily calories and total fat to 27% of daily calories. Low-fat dairy products appear to be especially
        beneficial for lowering systolic blood pressure.</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">When choosing fats, select
        monounsaturated oils, such as olive or canola oil.</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Choose whole grains over white flour
        or pasta products.</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Choose fresh fruits and vegetables
        every day. Many of these foods are rich in potassium, fiber, or both.</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Eat nuts, seeds, or legumes (dried
        beans or peas) daily.</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Choose modest amounts of protein (no
        more than 18% of total daily calories). Fish, skinless poultry, and soy
        products are the best protein sources.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      Other daily nutrient goals in the DASH diet include limiting carbohydrates to 55% of daily calories and dietary
      cholesterol to 150 mg. Try to get at least 30 grams (g) of daily fiber.</p>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      Check with your doctor before you increase the potassium in your diet or use salt substitutes (which often contain
      potassium). People who have kidney problems or who take certain medicines must be careful about how much potassium
      they consume.</p>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">2) HEART HEALTHY DIET</h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Eat foods that are naturally low in fat. These
      include whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Look at food labels. Pay special
        attention to the level of saturated fat.</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Avoid or limit foods that are high in
        saturated fat (more than 20% of the total fat). Eating too much saturated fat is one of the major risk factors
        for heart disease. Food high in this type of fat include: egg yolks, hard cheeses, whole milk, cream, ice cream,
        butter, and fatty meats (and large portions of meats).</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Choose lean protein foods. These
        include soy, fish, skinless chicken, very lean meat, and fat-free or 1% fat dairy products.</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Look for the words "hydrogenated" or
        "partially hydrogenated" on food labels. Do not eat foods with these ingredients. They are very high in
        saturated fats and trans fats.
        Limit how much fried and processed foods you eat.
      </li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Look for the words "hydrogenated" or
        "partially hydrogenated" on food labels. Do not eat foods with these ingredients. They are very high in
        saturated fats and trans fats.
        Limit how much fried and processed foods you eat.
      </li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Pay attention to how foods are
        prepared. Healthy ways to cook fish, chicken, and lean meats are broiling, grilling, poaching, and baking. Avoid
        adding high-fat dressings or sauces.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Other tips include :</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Eat foods that are high in soluble
        fiber. These include oats, bran, split peas and lentils, beans (such as kidney, black, and navy beans), some
        cereals, and brown rice.</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Learn how to shop for and cook foods
        that are healthy for your heart. Learn how to read food labels to choose healthy foods. Stay away from fast food
        restaurants, where healthy choices can be hard to find.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">2) Blood Oxygen Level(SPO2)
      Test :</h1>

    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">You probably already know that oxygen levels
      go through a sudden drop due to coronavirus. It causes severe shortness of breath and can be fatal as well.
      Coronavirus or not, oxygen is extremely important for us. Nutrition plays a central role in determining your
      health, including maintaining oxygen level in your body.</p>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Here are 3 foods recommends to take care of
      your oxygen levels :</p>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">1. Antioxidant-rich foods</h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">We all know antioxidants play an important
      role in maintaining health. Foods rich in antioxidants may protect your cells against free radicals and reduce the
      risk of multiple diseases (including heart diseases and certain cancers). “Avocado, bananas, carrots, celery,
      garlic, and dates have high antioxidant content and they are beneficial to health. Their pH value is eight. Dates
      and garlic have properties that help in regulating blood pressure.’ Clearly, antioxidants are capable of
      maintaining the oxygen level in your body!</p>
    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">2. Fibre-rich foods</h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Now, what do you think of fibre-rich foods?
      Well, fibre has various health benefits such as improving gut health, appetite reduction, and cholesterol level
      reduction. “Foods like alfalfa sprouts, apples, and apricots are fibre-rich foods that have a pH value of eight
      and are easy to digest as well”. In addition, “they contain lots of enzymes that help to maintain the body’s
      hormonal balance and yes, they definitely increase the blood oxygen level.”</p>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">3. Lemons</h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Lemon is the top oxygen-rich food. It is
      acidic but turns alkalin when consumed. Lemon has electrolytic properties and that makes it an excellent
      alkalising food. It is can also soothe cough, cold, flu, hyperacidity, heartburn, and other ailments. Lemons have
      the ability to cleanse the liver which is responsible for eliminating toxic waste out of your body.
      So, ladies, take care of your oxygen levels with these foods!
    </p>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">3) Cholesterol Test:</h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Your body needs some cholesterol to work
      properly. But if you have too much in your blood, it can stick to the walls of your arteries and narrow or even
      block them. This puts you at risk for coronary artery disease and other heart diseases. Cholesterol travels
      through the blood on proteins called lipoproteins. One type, LDL, is sometimes called the "bad" cholesterol. A
      high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. Another type, HDL, is sometimes called the
      "good" cholesterol. It carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Then your liver
      removes the cholesterol from your body.The treatments for high cholesterol are heart-healthy lifestyle changes and
      medicines. The lifestyle changes include healthy eating, weight management, and regular physical activity.</p>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">How can I lower cholesterol with diet?</p>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Heart-healthy lifestyle changes include a diet
      to lower your cholesterol. The DASH eating plan is one example. Another is the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet,
      which recommends that you</p>
    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">1. Choose healthier fats</h1>


    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">You should limit both total fat and saturated
      fat. No more than 25 to 35% of your daily calories should come from dietary fats, and less than 7% of your daily
      calories should come from saturated fat. Depending upon how many calories you eat per day, here are the maximum
      amounts of fats that you should eat :</p>

    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Saturated fat is a bad fat because it raises
      your LDL (bad cholesterol) level more than anything else in your diet. It is found in some meats, dairy products,
      chocolate, baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods.Trans fat is another bad fat; it can raise your LDL and
      lower you HDL (good cholesterol). Trans fat is mostly in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick
      margarine, crackers, and french fries.Instead of these bad fats, try healthier fats, such as lean meat, nuts, and
      unsaturated oils like canola, olive, and safflower oils.</p>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">2) Limit foods with cholesterol
    </h1>

    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">If you are trying to lower your cholesterol,
      you should have less than 200 mg a day of cholesterol. Cholesterol is in foods of animal origin, such as liver and
      other organ meats, egg yolks, shrimp, and whole milk dairy products.</p>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">3) Eat plenty of soluble fiber
    </h1>

    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Foods high in soluble fiber help prevent your
      digestive tract from absorbing cholesterol. These foods include :</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Whole-grain cereals such as oatmeal
        and oat bran</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Fruits such as apples, bananas,
        oranges, pears, and prunes</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Legumes such as kidney beans, lentils,
        chick peas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">4) Eat lots of fruits and
      vegetables</h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">A diet rich in fruits and vegetables can
      increase important cholesterol-lowering compounds in your diet. These compounds, called plant stanols or sterols,
      work like soluble fiber.</p>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">5) Eat fish that are high in
      omega-3 fatty acids.</h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">These acids won't lower your LDL level, but
      they may help raise your HDL level. They may also protect your heart from blood clots and inflammation and reduce
      your risk of heart attack. Fish that are a good source of omega-3 fatty acids include salmon, tuna (canned or
      fresh), and mackerel. Try to eat these fish two times a week.</p>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">6) Limit salt</h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">You should try to limit the amount of sodium
      (salt) that you eat to no more than 2,300 milligrams (about 1 teaspoon of salt) a day. That includes all the
      sodium you eat, whether it was added in cooking or at the table, or already present in food products. Limiting
      salt won't lower your cholesterol, but it can lower your risk of heart diseases by helping to lower your blood
      pressure. You can reduce your sodium by instead choosing low-salt and "no added salt" foods and seasonings at the
      table or while cooking.</p>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">7) Limit alcohol</h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Alcohol adds extra calories, which can lead to
      weight gain. Being overweight can raise your LDL level and lower your HDL level. Too much alcohol can also
      increase your risk of heart diseases because it can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride level. One drink is
      a glass of wine, beer, or a small amount of hard liquor, and the recommendation is that :</p>

    <ul>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Men should have no more than two
        drinks containing alcohol a day</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Women should have no more than one
        drink containing alcohol a day</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">4) Blood Sugar Test :</h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">If you have diabetes, your blood glucose, or
      blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from foods you eat. The cells of your body need glucose for
      energy. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells.With type 1 diabetes, your body doesn't
      make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose
      builds up in your blood and causes high blood sugar levels.Prediabetes means that your blood sugar levels are
      higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. If you have prediabetes, you are more likely to
      develop type 2 diabetes.</p>
    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">How do the foods I eat affect
      my blood sugar levels ?</h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">The sugar in your blood comes from certain
      foods called carbohydrates, or "carbs." Foods that are high in carbs include candy and sweets, sodas, breads,
      tortillas, and white rice. The more carbs you eat, the higher your blood sugar level will be.</p>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes,
      making the right food choices is an important way to keep your blood sugar at a healthy level. When you control
      your blood sugar, you lower your chance of having serious health problems from diabetes, such as vision loss and
      heart problems.</p>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">And if you have prediabetes or are at risk for
      diabetes, eating foods that keep your blood sugar levels healthy may help prevent type 2 diabetes later on.</p>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">What's the best diet for
      diabetes ?</h1>

    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">There isn't a specific diet or meal plan that
      works for everybody. Your health care provider may have you see a registered dietician (RD) or a diabetes educator
      who can help design the best eating plan for you. The plan will consider :</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Any medicines that you take</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Your weight</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Any other health conditions you have
      </li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Your lifestyle and tastes</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Your goals</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">All eating plans for diabetes have a few
      things in common, including eating the right foods in the right amounts at the right times.</p>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">What foods should I eat if I
      have diabetes?</h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Eating the right foods for diabetes means
      eating a variety of healthy foods from all the food groups :</p>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">Fruits and vegetables :</h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Whole grains, such as whole wheat, brown rice,
      barley, quinoa, and oats Proteins, such as lean meats, chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, nuts, beans, lentils, and tofu
      Nonfat or low-fat dairy, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese
    </p>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">What foods should I limit to
      control my blood sugar ?</h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">To keep your blood sugar under control, you
      may need to cut back on foods and drinks that are high in carbs. This doesn't mean that you can never enjoy them.
      But you will need to have them less often or in smaller amounts</p>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">The high-carb foods and drinks you should
      limit include :</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Sugary foods, such as candy, cookies,
        cake, ice cream, sweetened cereals, and canned fruits with added sugar</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Drinks with added sugars, such as
        juice, regular soda, and regular sports or energy drinks</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">White rice, tortillas, breads and
        pasta - especially those made with white flour</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Starchy vegetables, such as white
        potatoes, corn, and peas</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">You may also need to limit how much
        alcohol you drink, as well as how much fat and salt you eat.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">What else do I need to know
      about diabetic diets ?</h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">If you have diabetes, it's important to eat
      the right amount of food every day. Your eating plan will include how much to eat, so that you get the right
      amount of carbs in each meal or snack. You'll learn how to count carbs and measure your food.</p>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Eating at the right times is also important.
      You will want to plan for regular, balanced meals to avoid high or low blood sugar levels. Eating about the same
      amount of carbs at each meal can be helpful. Your eating plan will also teach you how to stick with your plan at
      home and when you eat out.</p>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Eating healthy to control your blood sugar
      does take some effort. But the reward is a chance to live your healthiest life with diabetes.</p>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">How to promote healthy diets
    </h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Diet evolves over time, being influenced by
      many social and economic factors that interact in a complex manner to shape individual dietary patterns. These
      factors include income, food prices (which will affect the availability and affordability of healthy foods),
      individual preferences and beliefs, cultural traditions, and geographical and environmental aspects (including
      climate change). Therefore, promoting a healthy food environment – including food systems that promote a
      diversified, balanced and healthy diet – requires the involvement of multiple sectors and stakeholders, including
      government, and the public and private sectors.Governments have a central role in creating a healthy food
      environment that enables people to adopt and maintain healthy dietary practices. Effective actions by
      policy-makers to create a healthy food environment include the following:</p>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">1) Creating coherence in
      national policies and investment plans – including trade, food and agricultural policies – to promote a healthy
      diet and protect public health through:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">increasing incentives for producers
        and retailers to grow, use and sell fresh fruit and vegetables;</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">reducing incentives for the food
        industry to continue or increase production of processed foods containing high levels of saturated fats,
        trans-fats, free sugars and salt/sodium;</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">encouraging reformulation of food
        products to reduce the contents of saturated fats, trans-fats, free sugars and salt/sodium, with the goal of
        eliminating industrially-produced trans-fats;</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">implementing the WHO recommendations
        on the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children;</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">establishing standards to foster
        healthy dietary practices through ensuring the availability of healthy, nutritious, safe and affordable foods in
        pre-schools, schools, other public institutions and the workplace;</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">exploring regulatory and voluntary
        instruments (e.g. marketing regulations and nutrition labelling policies), and economic incentives or
        disincentives (e.g. taxation and subsidies) to promote a healthy diet; and</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">encouraging transnational, national
        and local food services and catering outlets to improve the nutritional quality of their foods – ensuring the
        availability and affordability of healthy choices – and review portion sizes and pricing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">2) Encouraging consumer demand
      for healthy foods and meals through:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">promoting consumer awareness of a
        healthy diet;</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">developing school policies and
        programmes that encourage children to adopt and maintain a healthy diet;</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">educating children, adolescents and
        adults about nutrition and healthy dietary practices;</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">encouraging culinary skills, including
        in children through schools;</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">supporting point-of-sale information,
        including through nutrition labelling that ensures accurate, standardized and comprehensible information on
        nutrient contents in foods (in line with the Codex Alimentarius Commission guidelines), with the addition of
        front-of-pack labelling to facilitate consumer understanding; and</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">providing nutrition and dietary
        counselling at primary health-care facilities</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">3) Promoting appropriate infant
      and young child feeding practices through :</h1>
    <uL>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">implementing the International Code of
        Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes and subsequent relevant World Health Assembly resolutions;</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">implementing policies and practices to
        promote protection of working mothers; and</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5 mb-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">promoting, protecting and supporting
        breastfeeding in health services and the community, including through the Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative.
      </li>
    </uL>

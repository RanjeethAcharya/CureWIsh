      diet &
      nutrition is to support overall health and wellbeing by providing the body with the necessary nutrients it needs
      to function properly."</p><br>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Diet and nutrition are essential
      components of a healthy lifestyle. They play a crucial role in maintaining overall physical and mental well-being.
      A balanced and nutritious diet helps the body to function optimally, prevents chronic diseases, and enhances the
      quality of life. The website, will tells the importance of diet and nutrition
      and some tips for maintaining a healthy and balanced diet.
    </p><br>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">The human body requires a variety
      of nutrients to function correctly, such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals. These nutrients
      provide energy, support growth and development, and help to maintain a healthy immune system. A lack of any of
      these nutrients can lead to various health problems such as malnutrition, weight gain, obesity, and
      chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.</p><br>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">A balanced and nutritious diet should consist
      of a variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, healthy fats, and low-fat dairy products. It
      is also essential to limit the intake of processed and sugary foods, saturated and trans fats, and sodium. The
      Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes the consumption of whole foods and healthy fats like olive oil, has been
      shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.
    </p><br>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">In addition to a healthy diet, it is essential
      to maintain a healthy weight and engage in regular physical activity. Exercise can help to improve heart health,
      strengthen muscles, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Experts recommend at least 150 minutes of
      moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week.
    </p>

    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">It is also important to stay hydrated by
      drinking plenty of water and avoiding sugary drinks like soda and juice. Adequate hydration helps to regulate body
      temperature, transport nutrients, and eliminate waste products from the body</p>

    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">In conclusion, diet and nutrition are
      essential components of a healthy lifestyle. A balanced and nutritious diet, regular exercise, and proper
      hydration are crucial for maintaining overall physical and mental well-being. By following these tips, you can
      improve your health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Remember, small changes in your diet and lifestyle
      can make a significant impact on your health in the long run.</p>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-3" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">For adults :</h1>
    <h1 class="ml-5 mb-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 24px;">A healthy diet includes the
      following:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Fruit, vegetables, legumes (e.g.
        lentils and beans), nuts and whole grains (e.g. unprocessed maize, millet, oats, wheat and brown rice).</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">At least 400 g (i.e. five portions) of
        fruit and vegetables per day (2), excluding potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava and other starchy roots.</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Less than 10% of total energy intake
        from free sugars (2, 7), which is equivalent to 50 g (or about 12 level teaspoons) for a person of healthy body
        weight consuming about 2000 calories per day, but ideally is less than 5% of total energy intake for additional
        health benefits (7). Free sugars are all sugars added to foods or drinks by the manufacturer, cook or consumer,
        as well as sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates.</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Less than 30% of total energy intake
        from fats (1, 2, 3). Unsaturated fats (found in fish, avocado and nuts, and in sunflower, soybean, canola and
        olive oils) are preferable to saturated fats (found in fatty meat, butter, palm and coconut oil, cream, cheese,
        ghee and lard) and trans-fats of all kinds, including both industrially-produced trans-fats (found in baked and
        fried foods, and pre-packaged snacks and foods, such as frozen pizza, pies, cookies, biscuits, wafers, and
        cooking oils and spreads) and ruminant trans-fats (found in meat and dairy foods from ruminant animals, such as
        cows, sheep, goats and camels). It is suggested that the intake of saturated fats be reduced to less than 10% of
        total energy intake and trans-fats to less than 1% of total energy intake (5). In particular,
        industrially-produced trans-fats are not part of a healthy diet and should be avoided (4, 6).</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Less than 5 g of salt (equivalent to
        about one teaspoon) per day (8). Salt should be iodized.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-3" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">For infants and young children
    </h1>

    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">In the first 2 years of a child’s life,
      optimal nutrition fosters healthy growth and improves cognitive development. It also reduces the risk of becoming
      overweight or obese and developing NCDs later in life.</p>

    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Advice on a healthy diet for infants and
      children is similar to that for adults, but the following elements are also important :</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Infants should be breastfed exclusively during the first 6 months of life.</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">Infants should be breastfed continuously until 2 years of age and beyond.</li>
      <li class="text-white ml-5 mr-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">From 6 months of age, breast milk should be complemented with a variety of adequate, safe and nutrient-dense foods. Salt and sugars should not be added to complementary foods.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">Diet and Nutrition for our Prognosis Test :

    </h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;"> Making changes to your diet is a proven way
      to help control high blood pressure. These changes can also help you
      lose weight and lower your chance of heart disease and stroke.Your health care provider can refer you to a
      dietitian who can help you create a healthy meal plan. Ask what your blood pressure target is. Your target will be
      based on your risk factors and other medical problems.</p>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">DASH DIET</h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      The low-salt Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is proven to help lower blood pressure. Its
      effects on blood pressure are sometimes seen within a few weeks.This diet is rick important nutrients and fiber.
      It also includes foods that are higher in potassium, calcium, and
      magnesium lower in sodium (salt) than the typical American diet.
    </p>
    <p class="ml-5 mt-5" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">
      DASH Diet</p>
    <p class="ml-5" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">
      The goals of the DASH diet are :
    </p>
    <p class="text-white px-5" type="" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      Limit sodium to no more than 2,300 mg a day (eating only 1,500 mg a day is an even more effective goal).
      Reduce saturated fat to no more than 6% of daily calories and total fat to 27% of daily calories. Low-fat dairy
      products appear to be especially beneficial for lowering systolic blood pressure.
    </p>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      When choosing fats, select monounsaturated oils, such as olive or canola oil.
      Choose whole grains over white flour or pasta products.
      Choose fresh fruits and vegetables every day. Many of these foods are rich in potassium, fiber, or both.
      Eat nuts, seeds, or legumes (dried beans or peas) daily.
      Choose modest amounts of protein (no more than 18% of total daily calories). Fish, skinless poultry, and soy
      products are the best protein sources.
      Other daily nutrient goals in the DASH diet include limiting carbohydrates to 55% of daily calories and dietary
      cholesterol to 150 mg. Try to get at least 30 grams (g) of daily fiber.</p>

      What is diabetes ? </h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      If you have diabetes, your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from foods you eat.
      The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells.
    </p>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      With type 1 diabetes, your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't make or use insulin
      well. Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood sugar levels.</p>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      Prediabetes means that your blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes.
      If you have prediabetes, you are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.</p>
    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">
      How do the foods I eat affect my blood sugar levels ?</h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      The sugar in your blood comes from certain foods called carbohydrates, or "carbs." Foods that are high in carbs
      include candy and sweets, sodas, breads, tortillas, and white rice. The more carbs you eat, the higher your blood
      sugar level will be.</p>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      Whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, making the right food choices is an important way to keep your blood
      sugar at a healthy level. When you control your blood sugar, you lower your chance of having serious health
      problems from diabetes, such as vision loss and heart problems.</p>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      And if you have prediabetes or are at risk for diabetes, eating foods that keep your blood sugar levels healthy
      may help prevent type 2 diabetes later on.</p>
    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">
      What's the best diet for diabetes ?</h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      There isn't a specific diet or meal plan that works for everybody. Your health care provider may have you see a
      registered dietician (RD) or a diabetes educator who can help design the best eating plan for you. The plan will
      consider:</p>

    <p class=" px-5" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      Any medicines that you take</p>
    <p class=" px-5" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      Your weight</p>
    <p class=" px-5" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      Any other health conditions you have</p>
    <p class=" px-5" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      Your lifestyle and tastes</p>
    <p class=" px-5" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      Your goals</p>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      All eating plans for diabetes have a few things in common, including eating the right foods in the right amounts
      at the right times.</p>
    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">
      What foods should I eat if I have diabetes ?</h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      Eating the right foods for diabetes means eating a variety of healthy foods from all the food groups:</p>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      Fruits and vegetables
      Whole grains, such as whole wheat, brown rice, barley, quinoa, and oats
      Proteins, such as lean meats, chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, nuts, beans, lentils, and tofu
      Nonfat or low-fat dairy, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese</p>
    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">
      What foods should I limit to control my blood sugar?</h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      To keep your blood sugar under control, you may need to cut back on foods and drinks that are high in carbs. This
      doesn't mean that you can never enjoy them. But you will need to have them less often or in smaller amounts.</p>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      The high-carb foods and drinks you should limit include:</p>

    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      Sugary foods, such as candy, cookies, cake, ice cream, sweetened cereals, and canned fruits with added sugar
      Drinks with added sugars, such as juice, regular soda, and regular sports or energy drinks
      White rice, tortillas, breads and pasta - especially those made with white flour
      Starchy vegetables, such as white potatoes, corn, and peas
      You may also need to limit how much alcohol you drink, as well as how much fat and salt you eat.</p>

    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">
      What else do I need to know about diabetic diets?</h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      If you have diabetes, it's important to eat the right amount of food every day. Your eating plan will include how
      much to eat, so that you get the right amount of carbs in each meal or snack. You'll learn how to count carbs and
      measure your food.</p>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      Eating at the right times is also important. You will want to plan for regular, balanced meals to avoid high or
      low blood sugar levels. Eating about the same amount of carbs at each meal can be helpful.</p>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      Your eating plan will also teach you how to stick with your plan at home and when you eat out.</p>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">
      Eating healthy to control your blood sugar does take some effort. But the reward is a chance to live your
      healthiest life with diabetes.</P>

      1. Antioxidant-rich foods</h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">

      We all know antioxidants play an important role in maintaining health. Foods rich in antioxidants may protect your
      cells against free radicals and reduce the risk of multiple diseases (including heart diseases and certain
      cancers).</p>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">

      Ms Chopra said, “Avocado, bananas, carrots, celery, garlic, and dates have high antioxidant content and they are
      beneficial to health. Their pH value is eight. Dates and garlic have properties that help in regulating blood
      pressure.’ Clearly, antioxidants are capable of maintaining the oxygen level in your body!</p>

      2. Fibre-rich foods</h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">

      Now, what do you think of fibre-rich foods? Well, fibre has various health benefits such as improving gut health,
      appetite reduction, and cholesterol level reduction.</p>

    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">

      “Foods like alfalfa sprouts, apples, and apricots are fibre-rich foods that have a pH value of eight and are easy
      to digest as well,” Manisha Chopra said. In addition, she informs that “they contain lots of enzymes that help to
      maintain the body’s hormonal balance and yes, they definitely increase the blood oxygen level.”</p>
    <h1 class="ml-5 py-4" style="color: yellowgreen; font-weight: 700; font-size: 34px;">
      3. Lemons</h1>
    <p class="text-white px-5" style="font-weight: 640; font-size: 24px;">

      lemon is the top oxygen-rich food. It is acidic but turns alkalin when consumed. Lemon has electrolytic properties
      and that makes it an excellent alkalising food. It is can also soothe cough, cold, flu, hyperacidity, heartburn,
      and other ailments.
      lemons have the ability to cleanse the liver which is responsible for eliminating toxic waste out of your body.
